Resource Identifier (RI) Scheme name: dchub 
Status: Provisional

Scheme syntax:

   The syntax of the 'dchub' URI scheme is specified below in ABNF specified in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]:
      
	  dchub-URI   = scheme "://" authority ["/" [path]]
	  scheme      = "dchub"
	  authority   = hostname [":" port]
	  hostname    = hostname as specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
	  port        = port as specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986], defaults to 411
	  path        = user-path ["/" [file-path]]
	  user-path   = the name of a user
	  file-path   = the path to a file or directory

   The (same) syntax of the 'dchub' URI scheme is specified below in a less verbose form:

	  dchub://<host>[:<port>][/[<user>[/[<path>]]]]

   The hostname MUST be specified.

   Examples:
      dchub://example.com
      dchub://example.com:666
      dchub://example.com/John/uploads/applications/linux.iso
      dchub://example.com:411/John/uploads/applications/linux.iso

Scheme semantics:

   Direct Connect is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol used by Neo-Modus
   Direct Connect (NMDC) clients and reversed engineered for use in a number
   of other systems. There is no definitive publicly available specification,
   but the NMDC Project [DCPROTO] and Wikipedia [WIKI] contain a general
   description. The 'dchub' URI scheme specifies a hub within the Direct
   Connect (DC) network. The URI may also indicate a user and a file or
   directory that they share.

   A Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) client, given an URL, ought to connect to
   the specified address with the appropriate protocol commands and sequence. 
   
   The connected client ought to request a connection to the user via the
   appropriate commands and sequence.

   The client ought to queue the file or directory, supplied as the file path,
   via the appropriate commands and sequence. If the file path is omitted,
   then the queued file ought to be the user's file list. Path to a directory
   MUST end in a "/".

Encoding considerations:

   1. Generic Encoding

   The encoding UTF-8 SHALL be used, according to RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
   
   URIs originating from hubs MUST be encoded as UTF-8 regardless of hub encoding.

   2. String Comparison

   Some hubs MAY treat dchub: URIs that differ only in case of the user
   component as identifying the same resource.

   The 'file-path' SHOULD be case-insensitive.

   The 'file-path' SHALL be normalized prior to string comparison.

   3. Normalization

   The URI SHOULD be syntax-based normalized according to RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
   section 6.2.2, with below exceptions.

   Tokens (such as "." and "..") SHALL follow the security considerations of
   this document.

   Trailing slashes ("/") SHOULD NOT be normalized.

   The URI SHALL use scheme-based normalization according to RFC 3986 [RFC3986] section 6.2.3. I.e., the following URIs are equivalent:
         dchub://example.com
		 dchub://example.com/
		 dchub://example.com:411
		 dchub://example.com:411/

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

   The 'dchub' URI scheme is intended to be used by applications that are 
   using the NMDC protocol or are referencing NMDC hubs, users and files as network resources.

   Most Direct Connect applications support the 'dchub' URI scheme (or parts of it). 
   Applications that are supporting the file-path syntax (implicitly) 
   support the user syntax and applications that support the user syntax (implicitly) support the generic syntax.

   Applications and systems that are using the 'dchub' URI scheme include hub lists (e.g. in XML and HTTP form), 
   hub owners and operators (e.g. for redirecting and referencing other hubs), 
   client implementations (spanning multiple operating systems) and more.

   Support for the 'dchub' URI scheme include the original NMDC client (1999).

Interoperability considerations:

   1. Inconsistency of Hub and User Accessibility

   NMDC hubs may impose constraints on connecting clients that 'dchub' URIs
   do not encode, including requirements to authenticate with a username
   and password, to advertise a share of a certain size or composition,
   or to originate from certain IP addresses. Similarly, a user named in
   an 'dchub' URI might not be available to transfer a file, or have
   removed the specified file from their share. Therefore, software
   processing an 'dchub' URI SHOULD anticipate frequent failure.

   2. File-Path

   The file-path reflect the user's shared files and does 
   NOT reflect a system's underlying file system.

   3. Separator

   Path separator is a slash ("/").

Security considerations:
   See the protocol specification for generic NMDC security considerations.

   1. Distributed Denial of Service Potential

   The ongoing operation of NMDC's peer to peer connections provides
   opportunities for both malicious clients on certain hubs and
   malicious hubs to coordinate clients of those hubs in connecting en
   masse to an arbitrarily specified IP address and port.

   Both clients and hubs SHOULD verify that search and peer to peer
   connection requests contain valid IP addresses and ports.

   Hubs SHOULD mitigate these risks by only relaying such connection requests
   when they can verify IP addresses and ports are valid and belong to clients
   initiating such peer to peer connection requests.

   Hubs receiving malicious connections SHOULD signal to clients that they are
   not clients and thereby mitigate harm by preventing future malicious
   connections.

   Clients SHOULD effect similar amelioration through attempting to reconnect
   only to hubs to which they have initially connected once; by refusing
   further peer to peer connection requests to addresses identifying as hubs;
   and by providing upon connection referrer information regarding which hub
   has relayed to them the IP and port to which they are connecting.

   2. URI Path Encoding

   Client software SHOULD verify that 'dchub' URI paths remain within
   shares by ensuring that "/", "\", ".", ":", "..", and other
   meaningful tokens either do not appear or appear only where they do
   not allow unintended behavior. Client software which translates 'dchub'
   URIs directly into file system calls, especially, MUST disallow path
   components of "." and "..".

   In service of such a requirement, clients SHOULD either convert all
   UTF-8 text they receive to canonical form or check against prohibited
   and controlled path tokens in any form in which they might appear.

   3. Case-sensitivity Mismatches and Duplicated Shares Entries

   Matches and shares both accidentally due to differences in filesystem
   case-sensitivity assumptions and intentionally by malicious clients can
   arise filelists containing either entirely or up to case identical. Client
   software SHOULD detect these cases and avoid wasteful downloading.

   4. Attacks Confusing User and Path URI Elements

   The user and path portions of 'dchub' URIs overlap in appearance
   sufficiently to allow malicious construction of URIs which
   deceive users into navigating to a URI to a client the share of which
   they would not intentionally view by embeddeding a string resembling
   a user name within the path. Clients cannot entirely eliminate this
   risk.

   Similarly, syntactically special URI tokens such as "/" and "\" might
   appear in the name of a user. Client software SHOULD prevent unintended
   behavior when following such a URI.

   5. Generic URI Syntax Considerations

   RFC 3986 [RFC3986] section 7 and in particular section 7.4, "Rare IP Address
   Formats", applies to 'dchub' URIs.
